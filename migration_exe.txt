In the migration file:
From django.db import migrations
Def convert_salaries(apps, schema_editor):
        Parent = apps.get_model(‘peoples’, ‘Parent’)
For parent in Parent.objects.all():
        parent.salary = round(parent.salary)
        parent.save()
Class Migration(migration.Migartion):
        Dependencies = [
                (‘peoples’, ‘previous_migration_number’),
]
Operations = [
        migration.RunPython(convert_salaries),
]


After creating the file run the command:
Python manage.py migrate
