MONGODB
1. NOSQL DB is saved as a graph or as a key-value model, unlike SQL which is saved as a table.
They are large data sets that can get significantly worse.
2. Advantages:
- He has support.
- It has fast performance.
- He has a high tolerance. This means that he reacts well to changing situations.
Disadvantages:
* There is no standard query language for nosql, resulting in longer development time.
* There is a priority in nosql for fast and scalable performance than performance that remains the same over a long period of time, and requires repeated testing.[
* A nosql db usually has no schemas, which can cause errors, since there is no enforcement of the inserted data.
3.  The hierarchy of components in Mongo db:
DB- DB is a database that contains collections.
Collections- Collections is a database that contains several documents.
Documents- A document is an object that contains data in the form of a key-value.
4.  Each document should have its own id, so that we can identify (when inserting or deleting information from it) the document in a unique way when there are several documents.


If we do not define a certain id when we create a db, the database will automatically create an id for the document.
