Python - Exceptions, Lists
exeption:
1.  An exception is the processor's way of telling us that something in the code we ran is not correct. Each error has a type and a name.
When the program runs on the code and encounters an error it will stop (not completely) and raise the error "up", until there is nowhere to go, and then a message will be printed (so that we understand what we did).
When we write code we will pay attention to all the errors that may happen and try to catch errors by: try & except.


List Comprehension:
1.  List comprehension is a way to perform several operations in a short way in one line.
Basically run on variables and in addition you can put a condition on it.
2.  No, it is not mandatory to use list comprehension - it is an optional feature that can make the code more readable and sometimes more efficient.
