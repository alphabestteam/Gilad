Python - File Handling, JSON


file handling:


1.  The first reason for using files in our software is the longevity and survival of the information. When we use a variable, the length of time the information will be saved is until the program is terminated. On the other hand, when we use the file, the information will be saved until we decide to delete it locally.
A second reason is the sharing of information. Files can be shared between programs, while variables exist only in the same program.
A third reason is backup and recovery of the information. If and when information is deleted it can be recovered if it is saved as a file. But if it variables it is not always possible to do so.
